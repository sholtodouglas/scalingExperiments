    "This notebook is an exploration in strategies for scaling neural nets training for large models across multiple devices.

The second method requires the full input sequence be expanded to the full one-hot representation on each device, but the first method divides the size of that representation by the number of shards - saving more space. If you're token space is in characters, this doesn't matter - but some token spaces have 10s of thousands of entries. \n"
